#Documentation for Dave Levin
print-frame.py is used to print the packet contents of the trace collected on the router 

The NOTES files have the IP address of the server and the client ( I realize its not of use, since our Router trace doesn't have it)
Please have a look at the test-6, test-7 folders.
They have exactly the setup you wanted!
Two laptops connected wireless to the AP and doing a iperf transfer 
Srikanth's laptop has a mac address starting with 74:
My router has a mac address starting with 00:19 

The transmitted frames collected have the format as : 
time ,txflags,retx,successful_rate,total_time,Q len ,A-Q len, Q-no,phy_type,retx_rate_list ,seq no,fragment no,mac-layer-flags, frame-prop-type,framesize,prop time

received frame output have the format as follows :

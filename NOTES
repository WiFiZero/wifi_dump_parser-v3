DATA FRAME frame format for each of the paths, the frames are collected frm :
TX PATH :
time :
[txflags:],ampdu bit, fail, rts, cts, txagg
retry count ,
rate,
tx_total,
mpdu-queue-size
ampdu-queue-size
Queue-no(depending on the type of traffic AC class) 
phy_type
rates retried sequence with no. count on each,
<mac header follows>
src mac address 
dst mac address
seq number
fragment number 
[mac layer flags]wep, retry, order, power_mgmt, more_flag, more_data
[frame-type]to-from fields
frame size 
propogation time

RX PATH :
time :
[flags],short_pre,wep,badfcs,frag
freq ,
protocol ,
signal ,
noise,
antenna,
[rx flags],badplcp, rxagg, failed phy
rate,
rx queue time,
caplen,
rssi,
<mac header follows>
src mac address 
dst mac address
seq number
fragment number 
[mac layer flags]wep, retry, order, power_mgmt, more_flag, more_data
[frame-type]to-from fields
frame size 
propogation time



The tx descriptor has the timestamp of the starting of the last retransmission of the frame
=>If there are no retransmission, its exactly the time spent in queue and the contention of channel
=>If the queue is empty and there are no retransmissions : then it is contention time of the channel

When retransmission occur, subtract the propogation time of the #retransmission count from the total time 


Debug : Have to look at frames with screwed tx descriptors with time lost
Update on Sept 18, 2013 : Can't help such frames, discard them !

DATA FRAME frame format for each of the paths, the frames are collected frm :
Transmitted frames from the Access Point :
time :
[txflags:],ampdu bit, fail, rts, cts, txagg
retry count ,
rate,
tx_total,
mpdu-queue-size
ampdu-queue-size
Queue-no(depending on the type of traffic AC class) 
phy_type
rates retried sequence with no. count on each,
<mac header follows>
src mac address 
dst mac address
seq number
fragment number 
[mac layer flags]wep, retry, order, power_mgmt, more_flag, more_data
[frame-type]to-from fields
frame size 

Received frames at the Access Point :

frame size 

The tx descriptor has the timestamp of the starting of the last retransmission of the frame
=>If there are no retransmission, its exactly the time spent in queue and the contention of channel
=>If the queue is empty and there are no retransmissions : then it is contention time of the channel

When retransmission occur, subtract the propogation time of the number of retransmission count from 
the total time. This will not give the time the channel was busy when there were exponential backoffs.

Debug : Have to look at frames with screwed tx descriptors with time lost
Update on Sept 18, 2013 : Can't help such frames, discard them !
